For work, I run the global R&D (also known as product development) teams for the Apama Streaming Analyics product in the IoT & Analytics business unit of Software AG, based in Cambridge, UK.  My teams are mostly in Cambridge in UK and Hyderabad in India, plus a little New Hampshire in USA. I've been part of the amazing Apama team since joining as a software engineer and team lead when we were a tiny startup in 2000.  Prior to Apama, I worked as a Research Scientist for Xerox Research.  I hold a PhD and BSc in in Computer Science from Lancaster University.

For fun, my small number of "side projects" have mostly been eiter related to community projects for Apama, or prototypes of how different technologies can be used with Apama. I was particularly interested in the earlier days of Docker when I was involved in introducing the technology to Software AG, though my GitHub repos started couple of years later.

I'm married, with two teenagers (or at least they were teenagers when I wrote this in 2021), and a dog. When away from a screen I like to cycle (road and MTB) and in winter try to ski in the French Alps at least one week each year. Historically I would have counted myself as hillwalker, climber, and mountaineer, but the truth is that living in Cambridgeshire and having a family means there has been too little of that since the kids were born.
